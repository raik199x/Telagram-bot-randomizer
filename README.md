# Motivation

In moments when you need to make a queu to somewhere with your team, the most honest and less time consuming method is randoming.

For that purpose you can use this bot for half-automated randomization.

Since bot runs through telegram, you don't need to have static ip and your bot will be available as long as it is enabled.

# How it works?

When you setted up your bot, you can create reg token for your team so everyone can join bot.

Then you can create ticket like "Queu to clean room" and everyone (who need or want) can join that ticket, when 
everyone joined random, admins can start random and everyone get notification from bot which place did he\she get.

If someone don't like his position, he\she can try to create swap request with someone.

# Installation

First of all, you need to create your bot in chat with [bot father](https://telegram.me/BotFather) and obtain his token.

Then you need to modify *main.py* and insert your token.

To run this bot you need to install pyTelegramBotApi

	pip3 install pyTelegramBotApi
		
then clone this repositroy and simply run bot

	python3 main.py
		
To make it available for a long time i installed [termux](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/) on my android phone and run bot on it.
